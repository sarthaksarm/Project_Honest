# Project_Honest

This repository contains multiple generative models, including Bert. Each folder includes the ipynb file and the execution pdf of the results along with a txt file summarizing the evaluations per model before and after fine tuning them.
In order to run them, please open the file using say google colab and all files are self-runnable to reproduce the expected results.

Apart from the models, it contains the project related files like Status doc, Report, and Presentation.
